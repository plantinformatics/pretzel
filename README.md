## What is Pretzel

Pretzel is a web-based online framework for the real-time interactive display integration of genetic and genomic datasets. It is built on Ember.js (front end), Loopback.js (back end) and D3.js (visualisation).

This README is for developers looking to contribute to Pretzel. 

If you're looking to get started using Pretzel with all of the latest datasets. Please visit [https://agg.plantinformatics.io/](https://agg.plantinformatics.io/)

For documentation on how to use Pretzel please visit [https://docs.plantinformatics.io/](https://docs.plantinformatics.io/)
