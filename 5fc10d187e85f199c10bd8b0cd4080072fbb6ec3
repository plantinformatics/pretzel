minor changes to emacs editor config for project source files

emacs_config.el :
mmv_Dav127 : map ~/ to env HOME as dir-locals-set-directory-class expects an absolute path.
apply class project-root-directory to all of MMv, not just the current work-tree within it (mmv_Dav127).
define variable MMv, same as env MMv.
declare safe values for : js2-basic-offset js2-pretty-multiline-declarations
