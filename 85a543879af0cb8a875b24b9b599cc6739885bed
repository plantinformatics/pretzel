Dockerfile : comment out an extra npm install / ci which is already done in earlier RUN (3 previous) which uses NODE_BE as required;  this one doesn't, which will revert the package-lock.json format version.
The history of this extra line goes back to earlier commits :  Commit 2d7bfff5 replaced npm run build (which was not defined - maybe build:frontend) with cd /app && npm install, hence introducing a 2nd install in /app (--only=production was added to it in f17992cf).  Earlier commits had just 1 install in /app : 8c0b38e2, 35b163e9.  In summary, there is not an apparent need for it, so this commit comments it out, and it can be removed.
